# Pub files
# We recommend against adding the pubspec.lock file to your .gitignore.
# It should be committed to version control so that everyone on the team
# and your CI server uses the same versions of dependencies.
# However, if you have a reason to ignore it, uncomment the next line:
# pubspec.lock
